- Published detailed instructions for a DIY bluetooth controlled spider robot with an OLED display
  based on a custom pcb design on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvUhFBq7Z4g), 
  [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/mega-das/arduino-spider-robot-quadruped-57b832) and
  [Arduino Project Hub](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/mega-das/arduino-spider-robot-quadruped-57b832).
- Interestingly, he does not mention at all that he is just redistributing the STL files 
  created by RigesHsu in 2015 and only a modified version of the [original code by SunFounder](https://github.com/sunfounder/SunFounder_Crawling_Quadruped_Robot_Kit_for_Arduino). 
  He actually replaced the original copyright notice by SunFounder, added his name and 
  a BSD 2-clause license.
